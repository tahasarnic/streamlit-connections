First I checked my Wifi links to my laptop and discovered that the Xfinity Wifi (an unsecured network) was active rather than my Home Base (a secured network); then I called the automated line to try to get my modem reset; finally, after waiting ages for the reset, the automated system transferred me over to the tech support line - something I had NOT requested. The rep was very rude and insensitive; first he laughed at me, then he cold-transferred me to another line.

She then heard the WHOLE story and told me that she would call me later that day (yesterday) and let me know who would be coming out but that I should have been told it would take 14 days to fix. I was like - \"14 additional days... Cause it\\'s already been 1 full week since these wires have been exposed\"... So I never heard from Mrs. ** as she promised and I called in today and spoke with someone who told me they live in the Philippines and explained EVERYTHING yet AGAIN and long story short... My husband is on the phone STILL trying to get this resolved before September 12th as we were told today is when they are sending a \"technician\" out to bury our exposed wires. I am writing this because unfortunately Comcast is NOT WORTH USING! They have not apologized or resolved our issues!! We will be getting Apple TV & or Netflix after this! Please be warned...

I got a pretty decent deal coming from a previously handsome employee management discount with ATT. Although UVerse was even worse than Xfinity/Comcast, I put up with it because it was so cheap. So, Comcast. Good deal. Great internet speed. No contract.The first issue arose after a month and a half in. I kept getting a notification that I was about to reach my data limit and would be charged $10 per gig if I went over. I was never informed of data caps when I purchased. If so, I would have opted for EPB because they have none and I stream a lot. I can't have a data cap of 600gigs a month. So I called to complain and cancel. I had already contacted EPB and set up an install date. I'm not sure why but I called Comcast again to inquire more about the data cap and to tell them that I wasn't paying for overages. I was then informed that Comcast had decided to raise the data caps to 1050gigs. I was assured that I would never reach it so I decided to stay with Comcast.Now that that was resolved it was back to my regular schedule until I noticed that my internet speeds were gradually getting slower. Then over the past 3 weeks, the internet connection started dropping. I called and was told it was my router. That it was damaged and needed to be exchanged for a new one. I never got around to getting a new router but it kept dropping at the same time every day between 7 pm & 9 pm. So I contacted them again and the Rep fixed the issue and told me that the problem wasn't my router but the way it was wired.So after rewiring it was working fine but now it's not only getting slower every day but the connection drops frequently. Still between certain hours but always after 6 pm. It's so bad now that it's dropping the connection at least every 30 to 45 mins. That's just this evening and even now at 12:55 am EST. I have two choices... Wait between 7-10 mins for the router to reboot and reconnect on its own once the connection returns or I manually unplug and force a reboot which takes a while as well and still does not guarantee a connect even after all the lights are solid and flashing.Now I have the Xfinity My Account app which NEVER says there is a reported outage but instead just informs me that my router is not connected to the internet. I can also restart via the app but it's useless too. I've finally had enough. I'm leaving Comcast behind. It's become a complete hassle.

Almost 12 months with them, I started receiving calls that my bill will go back to the normal price, $79.99, if I didn\\'t change to another promotional price and added TV. I\\'m not a big fan of watching TV. Ok so I went ahead and picked a bundle for $49.99 a month. My services went off for 7 days when I saw 2 Xfinity men tampering with the Xfinity box outside of my residence. I called customer service, told them I was not going to pay my bill ahead if my services were not up and running. She said, \"I can send a technician to the residence to solve the problem at the cost $50.\" I told her I\\'d rather cancel than pay someone to fix something 2 Xfinity employees tampered.She informed me that she can waive that fee. I said, \"ok if you\\'re going to waive that fee then I\\'ll pay my bill whenever I get my service restored.\" 4 days later, I arrived home my service were restored. I called the next day to check on my bill and see if the service was waived and if I received a credit into my account for being off 7 days. They informed me that my bill was $33 so I went ahead and paid it. Month after that, my bill shows $141. I called and questioned them and they said that \"The fee wasn\\'t waived, it\\'s $99. We\\'re sorry for who ever misinformed you but you still have to pay the fees.\\'\\' \"A sorry doesn\\'t pay the bills,\\'\\' I said.

I\\'m not a big fan of watching TV. Ok so I went ahead and picked a bundle for $49.99 a month. My services went off for 7 days when I saw 2 Xfinity men tampering with the Xfinity box outside of my residence. I called customer service, told them I was not going to pay my bill ahead if my services were not up and running. She said, \"I can send a technician to the residence to solve the problem at the cost $50.\" I told her I\\'d rather cancel than pay someone to fix something 2 Xfinity employees tampered.She informed me that she can waive that fee. I said, \"ok if you\\'re going to waive that fee then I\\'ll pay my bill whenever I get my service restored.\" 4 days later, I arrived home my service were restored. I called the next day to check on my bill and see if the service was waived and if I received a credit into my account for being off 7 days. They informed me that my bill was $33 so I went ahead and paid it. Month after that, my bill shows $141. I called and questioned them and they said that \"The fee wasn\\'t waived, it\\'s $99.

And just an FYI: for the superiors responsible for training the reps this way make sure you also remember: \"no customers, no pay checks\". Without \"us\" there is no \"you\".I understand why this company has ranked the very bottom 7 consecutive years, and for that reason the pay will always be poor for the reps and the company Will either go under due to loss of revenue or just barely floating above water. Know that customers like I will gladly pay the extra $10 for the same service with someone else for a better experience.', 'row': 139}),\n",

I appreciated that as she was actually saving me a few dollars over my previous $250.00 per month package. I informed her that I will not require voice and that I own my own data modem. I asked her when my Extreme 150 would be available, she indicated immediately as long as I power off and on my cable modem and that the voice service would take 24 hours to activate. I was just fine with that because I do not need voice! This is where the NIGHTMARE begins! I performed the necessary steps of recycling my modem per the Comcast sales agent and was anxious to see my speed increase. Alas, there was no speed increase as shown by the Comcast Speed Test and others so I logged into my account to see what was happening. I was extremely surprised to see that my internet service was actually downgraded to ECONOMY. I noticed that my speeds started to decrease so I started an online chat session to gain assistance as the US office was now closed.

So, I contacted the activation team, who had absolutely no idea what I was talking about! They transferred me to technical support in Manila. After one hour of tech support doing who knows what, my internet download/upload speeds were 3mb and 1mb respectively. I asked why my account showed ECONOMY as I just had purchased EXTREME 150. The representative said I indeed had Extreme 150 and my service was pending activation! I told him that's why I am talking to him as the chat agent directed me there for activation! He transferred me to billing who said the my account is pending activation, even though my online account showed that the new service was active and the phone was pending. I asked for a supervisor. Sparing you more GORY details. Two hours later, I was assured that my EXTREME 150 would be running in the morning after I powered on/off my cable modem. You guessed it! No EXTREME 150, and my account showed that I still had ECONOMY internet. As a side note, not one COMCAST representative could tell me why! So, this morning, I once again called COMCAST, because I knew that I would be talking with at US representative and I might have a shot at getting this resolved! You guessed it! After 1 hour and repeated requests to talk to a supervisor (who were all in meetings), Comcast finally revealed to me the issue! I need a cable modem with voice capabilities. Oh, by the way that's another $10.00 per month! Of course I asked COMCAST all of the right questions: Why was I not told this at the time I purchased my new package? Why was I bounced around to multiple COMCAST support representatives, of which none could help me or explain how to resolve the issue?

I was told that while they could not lower JUST my internet, they could give me cable AND internet for 69.95, so basically the same thing but I would have cable as well. So I agreed...and this was where the nightmare began.They sent me a home install kit which I did and it never functioned. I was told after an hour of troubleshooting on the phone that the box appeared to be faulty so take it to the closest Comcast office and they would replace it. I did this. It too did not work. So finally they sent out a technician. He found an issue in the box outside that he rectified and the service now worked, HOWEVER he also told me I had an unnecessary booster amp on my service which he had removed so I should now have the best service I could get. He left. From that moment my internet did not work, it constantly lost signal. So they sent out a second tech two days later, who came in my home and said \"Oh they are sending the wrong rate code to your modem, so I have had that rectified and it\\'s good now\". He left and it still did not work. So a third tech came out. This time he verified I had poor signal and but was unable to fix the issue.

I moved to a new city wanted to get Internet Service. They talked me into getting Internet and Phone service as it was cheaper than getting the Internet alone. They told me someone could come out in a week and half. Pretty long time but ok. The technician Andrew came out and then told me they could not install as there was no line coming to the house. There is a concrete walkway in the backyard leading to the deck. So he said a contractor would have to come out and lay a line under the concrete. Then they could come out again.So days passed no word from them. I call they say \"oh you are pending.\" We will have someone call you in 24hrs to make an appointment. She calls back later and says \"oh you need a special permit to lay that line it will take two more weeks.\" I tell her I really need the Internet for job related reasons. Candice says \"oh you can use Infinity wifi if you see it on your smart phone. I do so she sets me up with an ID and password.\"I get off the phone and try to connect. No luck. I then talk to Danielle who tries to help me connect. She has no luck so she sends me to a technician that has more knowledge than she does. She then passes me on to a hotspot expert. Well by now I can connect but it is only like 1 mbps. So basically you can do nothing with it. She says she can\\'t help and sends me on to the next person. I say you aren\\'t sending me back to the very beginning. Sure enough she does. As I am talking to this person and please realize I have to tell the whole story each time I talk to a new person. This person says you can\\'t get wifi unless you have service set up. Grrr. All that time wasted with these people. As I am talking who is in my backyard but two Comcast guys to lay the line. What happened to needing a permit or two weeks?They say the technician doesn\\'t know what he is talking about you have a line all along. They say they will make a note about it. Just as I am getting ready to call them the next day there is a knock on the door. Three guys from Comcast are there to bury the line. What line it was buried long ago with the previous owners. No communication between the different departments. I call to them about the developments and when can they come out and connect the service in the house. They tell me it will take two weeks. I say you should give me faster service after all this hassle and a discount on my first month of service. They said \"oh we can\\'t do that.\" I say let me talk to your supervisor.

The technician Andrew came out and then told me they could not install as there was no line coming to the house. There is a concrete walkway in the backyard leading to the deck.

It is strange to me that a company that cannot keep their internet service working can IMMEDIATELY drop your service... I mean in seconds! Just a thought!\", 'row': 333}),\n",

Moving on, he apologized about the service and said that he\\'s never seen a rush service not be completed as it was escalated to urgent status. He said that it would be completed today the 12th. And I would hear back by 10 am.By 12:30 I called customer service AGAIN! After reviewing my entire situation yet again, the rep told me she would get a manager to call me back as I told her that I must have someone call me immediately. 2 hours later, I missed her call from another non existing number. She told me to call her back at her number. I called. This was the message \"you\\'ve reached this number at non business hours, please call back\". Needless to say, I haven\\'t heard from her. I called customer service yet again. I demanded my account be closed. Mind you that they won\\'t tell you that they tell you that they\\'ll see what they can do and promise a call back that doesn\\'t come. This new rep told me that I\\'m scheduled for service on the 19th! I adamantly refused and demanded a manager. After waiting 10 minutes, she came back on to tell me that she\\'ll connect me to a manager now... NO. I was sent back to customer service.My blood was boiling. In the meantime, I received a call from my buddy Mark. You know, the one who told me that I would get a call by 10 am and that today work would be done. He now told me that I\\'m set up for the 19th. Needless to say I was furious!!! He was excruciatingly rude, condescending... And he hung up on me. I returned my stuff to the store. I was told it would be a 60 minute wait. I said absolutely not and demanded a manager. \"Pam\" came over and told me that I can leave my stuff there but no receipt. I said there\\'s no way that I\\'m leaving my stuff with no receipt. She told me that she can\\'t give me one. I was calling the police. Which I would never do normally ever but this was just insanity and waiting another hour was not happening. A very rude rep came over and to me basically \"too bad, if you don\\'t want to wait, return it to UPS\".I headed right over to XFINITY and returned my stuff. I put my foot down and to Pam the supervisor that I\\'m not leaving without a receipt for my returned equipment which she refused to give me twice. I told her that I\\'m calling the police (which I\\'m not the type to do but this was all just too much). Finally, she agreed and gave me a receipt. Ps- the 4 people that came in after me were just as angry as I was. They also had serious complaints and zero tolerance when they were all told to wait an hour. What are the odds that in a 10 minute span, of the 5 customers that came in, all of us were furious at the non service received. Stay away from XFINITY / Comcast!

You have treated me like a used, worn-out rag that has been thrown to the side. Shame on you.I made an appointment yesterday with Comcast because my thermostat which was installed by Comcast stopped working yesterday, After getting a low battery light I proceeded to change the batteries. After doing so the thermostat would not light up. I called Comcast yesterday and after going through their troubleshooting the representative told me that she had scheduled an appointment with Comcast for 09/08/2015 and that they would be at my home between the hours of 9-11 a.m. My husband stayed home for the day after canceling all of his appointments. He is an accountant. At 8:30 a.m. a Comcast technician comes to my home and drops off a thermostat stating that an electrician would be by my home within the hour. At 1:00 p.m. my husband calls to inform me that the electrician never showed up and he had contacted Comcast who informed him that the call was noted as being resolved. He informed them that not only was it not resolved by on the hottest day of the year -- our home was a hot 91 degrees. He spoke with a woman by the name of Ashley. After speaking with my husband I too called Comcast and spoke with a gentleman by the name of Jonathan. I explained to him that my husband had been on the line with Ashley who stated that she had call a dispatch ticket in and stated that we should hear from someone within the hour. This was at 1:00 p.m. Since my husband had previously called Jonathan stated that we would hear from Comcast by 1:22 p.m. Of course that time came and went. I called Comcast back at 2:15 p.m. to advise that no one from Dispatch had contacted us. This time I spoke with Chris who stated that he was showing in his system that we were contacted and a electrician was en route to our home. Chris indicated again that Dispatch had advised us that they would be at our home. This was a flat out lie. No one from Comcast ever contacted our home. I called my husband to see if the electrician had arrived and he indicated he had not. I called Comcast yet again. By this time our home was a very hot 92 degrees. Side note: When the central air is controlled by a thermostat you have no cooling options. I spoke with a fourth person named Wally and demanded to speak with a supervisor because this was not acceptable. They stated they would be at my home to check on my thermostat. Between the hours of 9-11 a technician drops off a thermostat and advises that the electrician will be at my home within the hour of his drop-off time which was 8:30 a.m. So at the latest the electrician should have been here at 10:00 a.m. It is now 8:03 p.m. We are still waiting on an electrician after being told at 6:15 by a supervisor named Bree that someone would be here. Why is it that we can call Comcast 6 times, get six different answers, and still be in a home with no air and a room temperature of 92 degrees? When did it become ok to falsify documents and state that you would be fulfilling an obligation and then not have to do it? Oh and then the kicker, we are told that we do not have an appointment for today -- it is tomorrow. If all phone call documentation is pulled you will find in each call to Comcast we received different information. Not only did we receive different information but on the last call with Bree we were promised that an electrician would be at our home. Hmmmm, do you really think that someone will be at my home with the room temperature of 92 degrees at 8:06 p.m.? Please note that this is my formal complaint against this monopoly who obviously feels like my time is not of any importance. Not one phone call from them but trust me you will see that I phoned them 6 times. Really, what am I getting for my 375.00 plus dollars per month?

No phone call or email stating they are working on resolution or providing insight on usage. NOTHING! We just got text stating we are 110% over usage and only 7-days into cycle. We have only been home 4 days of the last 7. We decided last week to cancel service but even that is impossible. They transfer you or hang up on you. Not one person can answer your questions. The customer service department truly cannot help you. This is very bad customer service and not acceptable for a company that you pay thousands of dollars. We have lost faith in Comcast and wonder is they are fraudulently billing customers.', 'row': 350}),\n",

I am a Korean and had the fastest internet service in my country with low monthly payment. AND there is no limitation for the usage. Yesterday night, one message was popped up on my computer. It said my data usage reached almost 90% of my plan. I was shocked and angry. Data usage limitation? I haven\\'t heard about that before. So I called Comcast internet customer service. The customer representative said there is no data usage limitation on internet. She added that if the message keep popping up then contact Comcast internet security service. All of sudden, she said since I have been their customer almost 9 years she recommended to change the service program, as a bundle of internet and cable TV for $59. It was attractive but I said I was OK with my program now. But she kept pushing me to have the new bundle. So I said since I was not sure if I stayed in the same place in next year, I did not like to have one. But she said there should be no early termination and even if so they could handle it. I didn\\'t and don\\'t believe her words. But that was not an issue. So, in this morning, I felt uncomfortable about the message again, and called Comcast again. I asked about the data cap and the customer service representative said there is none. So I talked about the message but she said there is no data limitation for home internet service. I asked her to transfer my call to her manager. Then, she transferred my call to security department! The security department guy said they could not help me because I am not the account holder. I explained that I was calling for my wife and I am the one who pay the monthly payment. Then they explained me that there IS data cap/limitation. What a bummer... I argued that I did not sign on the contract under data limitation. He said it was implemented. So I argued that the Comcast only shows customer two different speed internet service without explaining data cap. And he said normal speed internet has cap of 250 GB and high-speed internet was 350 GB limitation. I haven\\'t hear of that. I quickly searched about that while I was on the phone and found only a handful cities in the U.S. have the cap, and Tucson AZ is one of them. That guy explained me that since I normally used under 300 GB except only one month I did not have to worry about the data cap and if I use more than that, they are going to charge 50 GB for $10 more.I argued that I had no memory to read that policy through their official letter and I had no reason to agree with the data cap because I signed the contract back in 2006. And I asked him whether there was another choice or different program. He said he could transfer my call to their sales department. But he transferred me to data usage department. I had to explain the same subject over and over again. The technician did not know what to do with my question. He did not even know there is a limitation. He said he could check the internet connection. So I said I was not talking about internet connection. Then he transferred my call to sales department. The sales department guy said there is no limitation again! And all of sudden she said there is. I told her I did not like to have limitation on internet usage. She said then I have to choose $350 internet service. And she added that was the only option, otherwise I have to pay $78 per month plus over usage fee for every 50 GB with $10. I just wasted my 2 and half hours with useless call and customer service. There was no way I could get help from them. Like you see, half of them didn\\'t know their internet service has data usage limitation. Other half did know but couldn\\'t handle my complaint. I did not sign up for the stupid internet data cap. If that service is like other mobile phone service, I cannot help accepting it (Verizon forced me to resign contract from unlimited data plan to 7 GB limited data family plan. Otherwise I could not change my broken Samsung smartphone) BUT, the home internet service is supposed to be unlimited. Internet itself is democratic and the providers are not.One comment the security department guy told me was like this, \"There is a limitation, but even if there is, we do not disconnect your internet service. However the fee on your billing reflects the usage, 50 GB for $10. That\\'s why the customer representative said there is no limitation.\" For my entire life I haven\\'t heard that kind of logic.

No one knows what they're doing there and they just pass it off to another department which is always the wrong department. I'm not kidding when I say 11 hrs on the phone with them. I kept track after the third phone call in a month. They say I owe them $100 dollars for the last bill. I told them they owed me money for all the bs. I also have the Internet box which I don't even want but I'm not giving them their stuff back if they won't erase my bill. They are an EXTREMELY fraudulent company and should be dealt with. If they offered $1 month Internet it's not worth the stress.\", 'row': 389}),\n",

He said I had to listen and accept something over the phone and then I would receive an email, so I did. This month my bill was $200 again and I could not believe it! I was very upset, so I called to cancel my service for cable but decided that I would keep my internet. I was told that I could cancel but because I am into a 2 year agreement I would have to pay $250 cancellation fee. I was speechless to say the least. I explained that I never signed anything to what I was asked if I had to go thru a phone acceptance.

They continued to try to upsale us on cable and finally offered a deal where either our internet and phone would cost more than what we would pay for internet, phone, and cable so I took them up on this. Eventually the cable price went up more and we started at paying 45 dollars a month approximately and ended up around 120. I started getting suspicious as every time I called them they offered me different prices on different things. Finally I decided it was time to remove all services other than internet because the bill was just too high. Every time I said I wanted to remove a service they told me they could discount it and this is after many people had told me the rates they were offering were their lowest rates and I wouldn't find anything lower anywhere else. I realized that the bundled packages aren't actually accurate offers. They tell you how much the internet cost at a higher rate than what they actually will charge you. Then they tell you the phone is only 3 dollars more a month. But if you cancel packaged services it opens up other pricings they won't reveal to you until after your service is cancelled. And even then you have to wait days until that cancellation has taken effect before they reveal the newly available discounted price for single service package.The worst part of all of this is that I was sold a 50 Mbps internet package without being told that in MN the maximum they can offer with that package is 25. They continually told me 50 is not available but then I find out that there is a 50 Mbps package (it is actually 105 but in MN the maximum they give for that package is 50). I didn't even want to start the conversation of requesting a refund for the difference in pricing between what they sold me and what they provided. I did eventually argue with a customer loyalty rep for a while about what pricing options they had available until she agreed to actually look and found the pricing option that I was referring to which she had insisted wasn't available.Their business model is so similar to illegal drugs. Get them hooked on convenience and affordability and then raise the prices and introduce new services at discounted rates only to increase those rates dramatically as well. If you call to cancel your services one at a time you can get the best prices out of them. I am now getting double the internet speed for half the price I was paying. Again straight up misinforming customers about what they are purchasing is my biggest complaint and secondary is their purposeful taking advantage of people who just don't happen to call in to ask if their services are available at lower prices.\", metadata={'source': \"I have had Comcast for 3 years and over time my internet cost has gone up tremendously.

I had arranged for new 75 mbps Blast! service to be installed today to replace my 18 mbps U-verse Internet (btw 12 mbps taken up by U-verse TV) between 10am and 12 noon, and appreciated the email and calls confirming the time. I was able to rearrange my phone calls and appointments, and put the dog in the crate. Thank you Comcast for respecting my time, the only resource I cannot get back.At 11:53, no one had called or shown up, so as a proactive customer service center you had me call into your 800 number, which asked if I was calling about my installation, and then proceeded to inform me that you were unsure when a technician would arrive, and transferred me to Shandra in customer service. Shandra told me my tech was on the way. In fact, Shandra was so good, that Shy (escapee from Inside Out - and yes that is her name) from the Sacramento OC Dispatcher team called at 12:05 to inform me my tech was running late and would be there in about 20 minutes. At 12:20, because of the proactiveness of Comcast, I called customer service again, figuring that the tech had to take lunch. I mean, no appointments are scheduled between 12-1 according to Comcast and they are subject to hourly wage laws. I spoke to two people including a manager who offered me $20 gift card or 3 months of a premium service for my time. Um, did you see I only have Comcast Internet, not Comcast TV? Oh yes, I was told that unlike Domino\\'s Pizza (yep, Comcast brought up Domino\\'s!!), who can track my pizza to my house, Comcast does not know where their tech\\'s are until they press a button on a phone or laptop. Hello, 2015 calling - if a tech does not enter an update 15 minutes before the next call, perhaps they are going to be late, and you may want to proactively notify the next customer? Comcast mentioned that they were going to be having such a service for customers in the future, so you will now be able to look up where the techs are not supposed to be. I think it will be an Apple Maps program they use to locate their techs.Or just look up Domino\\'s to find your Comcast tech.At 1pm, I called Shy in dispatch because Comcast expects me to follow up with them first when someone does not show up. Shy paused and asked if I had cancelled my service, because the person she had scheduled to show up by 12:20 had a cancelled ticket from me. She apologized and said it was a Comcast issue (be still my heart) and she would arrange a new call between 1pm and 3pm today. At 1:38 Comcast called me (woo hoo! I am special!) and told me the tech would be at my home between 1 and 3pm (it was 1:38pm) and more than likely would be here by 2pm. Are you sensing a pattern? 2:03, let\\'s call Comcast up to see how their automated system is working. Hello \"we are unsure of the arrival time of your tech, please hold for an agent.\" John comes on the phone, and he is good, and empathetic, and talks about under committing and over performing. He wants to take ownership of the issues - now someone is talking my language - and will call me back to follow up to see how the installation goes.3pm, who let the dogs out? Me, they were tired of being cramped up. 3:07pm, called Sacramento dispatch to talk to my Pixar friend Shy, no answer went into some IVR hell with options such as \"choose 4 for Not Home Service\". Hung up, called 800 number. My computer friend again said unsure when tech would arrive, passed me to an agent. She is trying to connect me to a supervisor. They are all busy exceeding customer expectations on other calls, and I ask her if she can have an agent call me back. I was in tears, begging, pleading, on my knees - please stop the Xfinity, I mean insanity! She said \"no\", there is no option to have a manager call me back, but they review all these types of cases so they can resolve them and prevent from happening again. I asked her, \"do you resolve these issues without talking or following up with the customer directly?\" And she said… wait for it… \"yes\". I asked her \"how can you provide customer service without involving the customer? How do you not have an option to have a manager or supervisor call a customer back?\"As I was on the phone with the customer service person the tech showed up. His name is NoName or we can call him Tech 7546. He never introduced himself. As he walked in carrying dirt on his shoes (btw AT&T tech all put on booties over shoes when they come into homes) and smelling of an overflowing ashtray (he does not drive for Uber in his spare time) he said he was from Comcast (thank you!), and then he was on time for his 3pm-5pm appointment. Valerie came home and could not park, because NoName parked in her spot in driveway instead of on street.He was on time! Thank you #Xfinity! I love Comcast for showing up on time 3 hours late. But they continued to exceed my expectations, my pretties! \"Hmm, there is no cable here, you need to have one installed\". \"Yes\", I responded, \"just like the work order I put in requested. Let me show you the attic access I have had cleared out for you all week\". NoName went outside, checked the box, came back with his ladder and more dirt because Comcast wants us to exercise after they leave, thank you for thinking about me. He looks in attic and says, \"I cannot fit in there. We need a smaller tech and it is hot in the attic. I cannot do this job\". NoName is skinnier than me, I can get in the attic, and we had 3 people in there last week cabling electrical and network cables without an issue. NoName leaves, head down, shoulders sunken back to his truck. 10 minutes later, I get a call from Comcast. They are calling me! Publishers Clearing House must be outside!

The installation should be done early in morning because it is hot in the attic, in Florida, in the summer, during the day when we do our jobs.\" I asked her, \"like between 10 am-12 noon?\" She said \"yes\", but had an 8-9am opening. Oh Joy! Comcast will allow me to wake up earlier to set expectation of not showing up that much better!But I missed John\\'s call. Yes, John who wanted to help and take ownership called me back at 3:26, and apologized for not calling at 3pm. \"I see the tech arrived at 2:45, hope all went well and I will call you back shortly\". 2:45?? Well he is closest to the pin, and he did call back so I give him kudos for doing what he said. So now we wait, I called Executive Customer Relations in Philadelphia, where the difference between normal customer service reps and Executive ones is the Executive team has access to better drugs. They are on morphine and do not have any emotions after dealing with issues like this all day long. She tells me a manager will call me back within 24 hours. I asked her \"24 hours Comcast time?\" There was no response.So now it is Minions time, the Amc 8 Movies Sunrise serves alcohol so it should make the movie even better. At least I will feel better, whilst I dream of little Comcast trucks driving around a neighborhood but never stopping anywhere. And I have XFINITY to thank for showing me how sales and customer service are supposed to work, and exceeding customer expectations.

Then I was told I could use my own modem (I specifically asked if it would be compatible). He resoundingly said “it would work just fine” -- WRONG! That's another $10, plus tax, a month for the Xfinity/Comcast modem (Or you can purchase one from Best Buy for $200).

He flatly tells me, that's not something they do and it is my responsibility that I resolve it with cancellation department. Ridiculous internal communication and follow up.

Before leaving, he asked me to get an usb cable and other things from Amazon to speed up my services. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about when I am supposed to have a wireless connection for all devices and I have a small apartment and all devices are close to the router. Finally I decided I have had enough (my internet speed is now down to 15 MBPS) and I cancelled the services from June 4, 2015. I called them o/a May 24 and schedule return of all equipment. I also pay all my outstanding bills. Imagine my consternation I receive a new bill of $122 for services from June 4 to July 3, 2015. I called the customer services again and somehow navigate my way to speak to someone at the payments department. I tell him my problem and he asks me to call cancellation department and resolve this. I request him to send a note to cancellation department or maybe talk to them internally to resolve my problem. He flatly tells me, that's not something they do and it is my responsibility that I resolve it with cancellation department. Ridiculous internal communication and follow up. I guess in order to not be charged with bills for services not received, I shall have to call them again. So sad. Comcast used to be a good company. Next time I will choose a smaller service provider who will attend to my needs and solve my problem. I wish some of us will get together and file a class action suit to hold these Company to better standards. You pay a lot and in return you are treated so bad that it hurts.\", 'row': 486}),\n",

The last battle I had with them I got transferred 3 times when I was about to quit Comcast for good because a new company just moved into my area (Seattle) and I was telling them it\\'s possible for me to pay less. Only then do they listen to you and this woman finally just clicked a button and changed my bill back to 49.95$ per month. And this was after I got a bill for 88.45$ for my monthly charge. And this woman was actually American - after talking to two foreigners they finally transferred me to someone local because they knew I was ready to quit and none of these workers likes to have that on their record because it looks bad on their quotas or how ever they do it.And finally after all this pretending like she went out of her way to work really hard to look for a deal she could offer me she promised me to change my bill back to 49 and some change when I check it the next day and it still shows up as 88.45$ that I owe so I am just about to call the map once again to complain. I broke my own rule when I forgot to ask for her ID number to keep her accountable.In conclusion I am still constantly looking for a company that is willing to start offering a decent rate for internet service. Comcast is a horrible monopoly for the most part and it\\'s only getting worse. They are buying up smaller companies that can\\'t compete just swallowing them up one by one, like Charter and smaller local companies. Please everybody keep posting your bad reviews and spreading the word, they are just treating customers horribly because they can and we need to stop putting up with it.', 'row': 531}),\n",

We had a business and bought business class high speed Internet just because of the stable IP, the speed was really bad.. We consistently had problems and the problem was never in our house. IT was always their lines. Now (2015) I need high speed internet. For years we have been using speedtest.net to calculate our speed since Comcast would NEVER tell us what speed we were buying. No wonder. We have always had a ping of about 50 ms, download speed of 8.48 mbps and upload of 0.78 mbps. Today I spoke with a technician since I am being timed out by the VA, Netflx, Xfinfity downloads, etc. He said it can't be fixed because the lines need to be replaced and Comcast has no interest in doing that. Interestingly, Verizon has customers in the east part of town and they have FIOS. I understand Comcast and Verizon decided to split this area and I am on the wrong side of the division. The tech today actually reduced my monthly fees because the speeds are so bad...he says they don't even offer these speeds anymore.

IT was always their lines. Now (2015) I need high speed internet. For years we have been using speedtest.net to calculate our speed since Comcast would NEVER tell us what speed we were buying. No wonder. We have always had a ping of about 50 ms, download speed of 8.48 mbps and upload of 0.78 mbps.

Interestingly, Verizon has customers in the east part of town and they have FIOS. I understand Comcast and Verizon decided to split this area and I am on the wrong side of the division. The tech today actually reduced my monthly fees because the speeds are so bad...he says they don't even offer these speeds anymore.

Was unable to fix the problem, but was told I would have $20 credited to my account for them being late.6-7-2014 @ 9:38 am called Comcast back (26 minute call) to say I was still having problems with internet service. Was able to talk to an intelligent person who updated the router firmware which fixed the problem. He also, because of the problem the day before and the continuing problem that he fixed, offered to double my internet speed and lower my bill from $140 a month to $90 a month for a year. I agreed and checking on speakeasy found that my speed had, in fact doubled. 7-14-2014 Went online to pay my bill and it was for $267.95.7-16-2014 Drove to local Comcast office to discuss bill. Was told that they were unable to make any changes in the bill, but the girl did itemize the bill and said at least $67.75 was a double billing and was an error. She gave me a number to call. At 4:20 pm called Comcast billing (46 minute call), the first person I talked to said that the bill was correct and there was nothing they could do about it. When I mentioned the $67.75 double charge, they acknowledged it was an error, but said that they weren\\'t authorized to fix it. I asked them to connect me with someone who was authorized to fix it. The next person was a little more helpful, but said that they were unable to do anything either and that I would have to talk to someone in Customer Satisfaction. The first thing this person told me was that the bill was correct and that I would have to pay it. When I asked her about the $67.75, like the other people before her, she acknowledged that it was incorrect, but she didn\\'t have the authority to remove the charge. I went over the previous story about how I changed my service to get the lower rate and her response was, \"Well, honey, you are getting a significant discount for what you are getting.\" I told her that I was only interested in getting service for less than what I was already paying and not more. After 30 minutes I was able to finally get her to remove all of the extra services to where it was before, however she was unable to get the $67.75 removed.

No call back and I forgot about it until now and see they are still charging me for a rental. So called again and now they want me to go back to the service center with the receipt for the modem I purchased over a year ago! They will then \"investigate\" and remove charges. Really... I\\'ve been a customer of Comcast since 1998 and have had issues with them before but now they are telling me they don\\'t care anymore. Just the aggravation of having to drive there again, wait in line and prove to them that I bought the modem. I asked the Comcast rep if there was someone I could speak with that could resolve this issue and she said no, I had to go to the center. I think Comcast has lost the idea that customers are number one and they\\'ve gotten too big to handle stuff like this. It\\'s very disappointing but DirecTV, here I come.', 'row': 756}),\n",

I don’t subscribe to the land line or TV so Internet is all I need. I switched on Jan 5, attached wireless router to my own cable modem, Comcast tech connected the modem and everything was ok - until Monday Jan 20. After 5pm on that day, my whole family started complaining about outages that would occur 3-4 times an hour and last anywhere from 2 to 10 min. I did quick troubleshooting and realized that cable modem loses the signal then regains it. Naturally, I decide to contact Comcast tech support, without knowing yet that what will happen next will be beyond Good and Evil – just incredible.So my first contact is made via Comcast chat, in between two outages. At this point chat was broken by yet another outage. So, I immediately drive to the store and fork out $75 for DOCSIS 3 model from Zoom Telephonics. I install it, my computer asked me to run Comcast registration for the new device and everything connects. I live happily for another 30 min. Then, as you guessed already, another outage occurs and 15 min later – another one.I go into chat again and request reimbursement. Agent asks if I have a proof that such reimbursement was indeed promised to me, to which I reply that I saved the entire conversation to PDF file. Agent then files a case and tells me that I will be contacted within 2-3 days (which didn't happen yet but it may happen later). Ok, done with financial matters, now onto the technical issue. This time, I decided to use the phone because outages wouldn't let me finish chats. I am transferred to someone with heavy Indian accent.It is about 11.30 pm, I have no Internet and I understand that I am dealing with lousiest tech support in the world that has no competence, training or just a common sense. I switch us back to the old modem for now. I am about to give up and switch to AT&T first thing in the morning, but my wife, equally enraged, wants to press on. So she dials the support number.At this point I raised my hand to smash the phone into the wall, but instead, I just hang up. Next, I continued troubleshooting and after a couple of modem and router reboots I got us back online albeit with outages. Computer, of course, had nothing to do with it and couldn't have, even in theory. The last conversation also got me wondering if these support guys in India actually wear two hats, one for support and another for sales? In any case, if previous agents were just incompetent, this guy truly deserved the title of King of Morons.The next day, I decided to give it the last try before going back to AT&T and connected to a chat from work (internet at home was unusable) . Surprisingly, this chat agent, after checking my case notes on file and reading my messages, said that she is going to dispatch a technician to my house because it is obvious to her that the modem, or router or computer had nothing to do with the issue I was having. She scheduled the appointment for me. Out of curiosity, I asked which modem is currently registered with Comcast. She replied “Your Zoom modem is registered as your own and connected to Comcast.” Then I asked her how come that agent from yesterday demanded that I register my modem by the phone call and guys in activation department tried to do it and failed, and then they tried convince me that it is their own modem and if not, I have to go to the local office to resolve the issue? She replied that unfortunately, she has no clue why previous two agents were giving me wrong directions and wrong info.So the tech appt is scheduled for the end of this week and guess what?

After 8 years of paying them well over $200 a month for mediocre at best service, I moved to an area where (thankfully) Comcast does not rule. I called them to shut off service and we discussed that I would gladly return six pieces of equipment. Each piece was verified on the phone and the address to where I could bring the items. I am disabled so this meant I needed to enlist someone to take me to their main Borg ship on Plato Blvd. in Saint Paul (as instructed). How surprised I was to find that they no longer occupied that building. Myself and several other confused people were instructed to drop our equipment in the drop box. I was rather concerned but the person in line with me worked for Comcast and advised that they \"just junk it all\" anyway. So, several days later I received an $800+ bill, which I had to call, sit on hold and wait to find out it was equipment charges as they never itemize \"new charges\". They advised me that they would update the bill and send a new bill just as soon as the equipment was logged as returned. 2 weeks later I get a bill that has the amount I owe $82.30 and some $ 25.00 mystery \"new charge\". I called and of course had no time to hold to find out what this was all about. Within 2 days of my receiving the bill, I get a collections call from Diversified collections, demanding $82.30??? Huh? So I call Comcast once again, to ask why I was turned over to collections two days after I receive my final bill and what the 25.00 is for? They advised me it was because of an un-returned router! Wrong! I work in telecommunications and I know that if they were charging me over $800 in equipment, the router would have been the most expensive part of that equation. So either they are lying about the charge, lying about the real cost of the equipment and its value or just trying to squeeze more money out of me. Once again I had to reiterate the entire story of having to go to drop off equipment (with witnesses) and that I was not buying their story. I paid what was due and not a penny more. I am still receiving collection calls for the $82.30 and am now going to file a complaint, for all it will do with the millions of others to the BBB. Please!!

I said, \"it was working immediately before I switched and is not now, so this is your problem.\" Long story short I finally sucked it up and went to Signature Support (i.e. paid support) and they told me it would cost $14.95 to get it working. I said, \"what the hell\" and OK-ed it. Then after changing some settings it worked again. I sensed that I\\'d been set up on something, so asked and the rep said I had signed up for the $14.95 recurring service plan. I had him transfer me over to cancel that immediately and did. Then looked at my bill and not only was I still on the $14.95 plan they had charged me $50 for the call. I was pissed but figured I could get that off the bill by threatening to cancel. Then my son mentioned that he thought the Comcast wireless was slow compared to Century Link. He watches a lot of MLB videos and they were all breaking up.

The problem continued. The second tech did absolutely nothing.The third tech was here for over two hours. He connected his laptop to our modem and using some kind of diagnostic program, he monitored the signal for about an hour and a half.

So, I called again, explained the situation all over again for about the 5th time and they once again set up an appointment for a tech to come out. The day the tech was supposed to come (Oct. 2nd) I received a call from him that afternoon. It was the same tech who had been here for two hours a couple weeks earlier. He said they had received a complaint from another customer who is in our 'node' who has been having the same issues with their internet signal. He also said he had continued to monitor our situation and continued to see the problems with the signal.He asked if it would be okay for another tech to come later in the evening, hopefully during the time frame when we have the problem (8:30-10:30) so that tech could see it for himself.

First bill comes, and the price is higher than my previous bill (for the same service), and significantly higher than the quoted price. Comcast denies their original price, continually states that their stated price was \"not something they offer\", and says they will need to review the previous call recording and contact me. They fail to do so, and upon contacting them, they will not address the previous call recording, although I suspected it had been reviewed. After multiple calls and several hours I offer to mail their legal department my copy of the original call - which they stated they were recording - and which my cell phone had recorded as well. Suddenly I get something slightly better than the original quoted price and phone service added. Comcast had already confirmed multiple times that there was no way for me to get this offer. I know they sometimes offer a discounted \"triple-play\" price that is less than internet + TV combined - there was no confusion, this offer only came AFTER I stated I had a recording of the original call.In the vast majority of my calls, I was abruptly dumped to collections by employees who did not even collect basic information.

Not once in my life had I any terrible devastating customer service experience with them like I just had with Comcast. After doing some long hard research, I notice it would be worth changing my Internet service to Comcast. The reasons were simple: I had AT&T 12 Mbps and was paying $39.99. Then notice Comcast 25 Mbps for $29.99 for 6 months for newer customers and then $44.95 after the six months.So the reason was simple, I pay a little less for six months and then 11% more every month after 6 months but will get 52% more speed just for 11% more cost. This was the simple reason I called Comcast last week and got the service. I am a first time customer of Comcast so I asked all the questions I know that matters to my Internet service. The representative explained the same rate plan for first 6 months and next 6 months and then I was told the technician will come over to my home this week (August 26th, 2013) to install the modem and turn the service on. I told the representative that I wish not to use their modem due to paying additional $7/Month a rental fee. So I provided the information of the Modem that I wish to use (Motorola SB5100) and the representative mentioned it works with Comcast and would have no problem with the internet service. So I order the modem and today, August 26, 2013, I had my internet service activated from outside my home by Comcast.1st Worst Call Customer Service Experience: HorribleAt 5:40ish PM today, I called Comcast to have my modem active WHICH I WAS TOLD BY THE COMCAST REP THAT WILL WORK. The whole worst experience started with Comcast automated phone service system. I had to find my way around just so I could speak with any representative due to the wait was 1 hour and 15 minutes. It took me 20 minutes before I could speak to one representative. Finally after long 20 minutes, I spoke with a live person who then took my information and took another 10 minutes before he said he will be transferring my call to the Internet Department where they will activate my Motorola Modem. He transferred my call and the representative (female) answered my call and just within a minute, my call got disconnected. After a long 30 minutes when I was about to get my modem activated, my call would get disconnected. I thought someone would call back because all the representatives were constantly asking me my phone number but after 5-10 minutes of wait of not receiving any call, I decided to call again.2nd Worst Call Customer Service Experience: Insulting and Rude BehaviorSo this time, I call again trying to find my way out to somewhat eliminate that 1-hour wait and luckily I did by simply going to Account Department. There I explained the whole situation and the representative transferred my call to the Internet Department after another 15 minutes total wait. This time the representative (male) I spoke with in Internet Department did everything he could just to make my entire first time experience with Comcast a worst Nightmare. I explained to him that I obtained the information regarding the Modem that I personally purchased to use with my service after it was clarified to work with Comcast by Comcast Representative. I provided the details written underneath the modem which was the Serial Number and the MAC ID. After few minutes the representative came back from putting me on hold and said the modem is at the End of Life and will be Broken soon and said I need Docsis 3.0. Now, I did not understand these increments so I asked what that means and he explained that the modem could stop working in the future or one of these days because it will no longer be supported by the Comcast. I explained to him I was given the details by the Comcast Representative last week when I signed up for the service and he NEVER SAID ONCE any of this and neither did he say this is not what I need. So how come after I verified with Comcast and ordered the modem and even canceled my AT&T Service, you guys are telling me today when I will be without Internet by tomorrow. This Internet Department Representative started getting upset at me and said why would I go purchase something else from the market when Comcast will be providing with the Modem and why would I make this decision and coming back to us telling that we had given the wrong information. I felt so insulted and felt if I am Comcast customer then I must become slave and follow what Comcast wants me to do. I asked him that I would like to speak with his immediate manager or supervisor and after a minute or two of putting me on hold, he said he has the supervisor on the line and will be transferring my call. I kept on saying \"Hello? Hello?\" for almost a minute or two after being transferred but I heard no voice and then again like first time, my call was disconnected.3rd Worst Call Customer Service Experience: DisasterThis time I called back again just to simply have the service canceled completely which I did not even use ONE SECOND. So after nearly one hour of time that was wasted and being humiliated and insulted by Comcast Representative, I chose to speak with someone in the Customer Care Department hoping I would find a manager or supervisor there. After a few minutes, I spoke to a female voice who I explained this whole horrendous experience I went through and explained to her that not once had I ever had such experience with AT&T in 8 years of being their customer. For a second, I thought maybe because I was talking to someone in Customer Care Department, this person would do everything to make my experience better. But all this representative said was sorry for what I felt and asked me what she wants me to do now. She said the modem is at End of Life and when I asked if that modem supported WiFi, she said it does not because this model is 2.0 and WiFi modems are 3.0. The whole experience from talking to account representative to Internet representative to Customer Care manager was simply horrible, terrifying, and insulting as it didn\\'t matter to anyone keeping the customer as their account holder. I told her I simply wanted to cancel the service which I just signed up for. She stated to do that I will be transferred to Cancellation Department but I told her that I do not want to go through the hassle again and requested her if she could be the middle person and directly explain to them the whole issue I was facing before transferring my call. She said she will make all the notes of which she and I talked about and the Cancellation Department will review them first. After she made the notes, she said she will now be transferring my call. And as my call was transferred, it once again was disconnected. This time I simply had it with Comcast and again chose the option to go through Customer Care Department and ironically the department was closed because it was 7:08 PM and the customer service department is ONLY OPEN from 7 AM - 7 PM. This person knew this but did not bother to inform me or take the initiative to make my experience any better but simply said, \"I am sorry,\" and transferred my call and after 1 hr and 25 minutes, I end up with no help but with one hell of a disaster customer service experience in my life.I simply want this service that I just signed up for last week on August 19th, 2013 to be cancelled as I do not wish to be a part of the company which has no respect for its customers at all. Honestly, I don\\'t even think i would get any response from whoever I am sending this to after the experience I went through but if you guys have any dignity, then improve your customer service and teach your management to take charge.', metadata={'source': 'I had been customer of AT&T/-Verse for nearly 8+ years.

I had a scheduled appointment for service in my home for 1 or 2 days after my move in date. Appointment was for 3pm. My fiancee got home at 3:10pm and the Comcast tech was sitting outside in his truck. So my fiancee walks over and asked him if he was here for my home and he just shook his head, said no and pulled the window up in her face. So she called Comcast and asked if anyone was coming over to put service in the house that day. They said yeah the tech was there but nobody was home and my fiancee told Comcast that there\\'s a Comcast tech outside and he said he wasn\\'t here for the house so she said oh yeah. He put his paperwork through that nobody was home and then said but regardless of what he should\\'ve still provided service if he knew that you hit home. But anyways we got scheduled another day that was like 4 day later. A different tech came out and service home. He did whatever it is he had to do. So he was getting ready to hook the TV on with the box after he finished running all the cable wire. He plugged the cable wire into the cable box and got shocked (red flag something is wrong). Anyways he proceeded, he went and got the hdmi cable and plugged it into the cable box. Then as soon as he plugged in the hdmi to my TV my TV caught fire through the hdmi cable I believe and had me sparks. Now my TV does not work and also my DVD player that was plugged into the TV does not work. So he gathers his stuff, calls Comcast and make a report. 1hr later Maby, his supervisor, came to my house to check up on what happened and went on saying how he apologize for what happened and said that the tech told him sleuthing was wrong with the house. That it was not grounded. And then went on saying how their tech army electricians that they wouldn\\'t have I known if it was grounded or not. So I told him, \"don\\'t you guys give them training on that or you just tell your techs hey listen ummm if you are putting in service in a home and you almost get your face blow off then that means the house has a problem.\" But anyhow he went on saying that we should be getting a call that same day nowhere than the next and since their box is what caused all this to happen then they are going to reimburse us for our stuff. 2 days went on and we received no call. So we called and they said we should be getting a call in 6 to 7 days. 6-7 days later no call. We called again and they said we should be getting a call in 24 hours. I let 2 more days pass and no call. So 2 days after that I called again and this time they told me that they don\\'t know why they told me that I would get a call in 6 to 7 days because it takes 30 days. So I got mad and requested a manager. Manager was more cool about things and felt bad about everything I went through and said I should get a call in a day or 2 and if I didn\\'t that I should call back and they would send my report to corporate. So 2 days pass and I get no call. So I call back and it got send to corporate. Next day I get a call from Cable Net and they went on saying that they are not responsible for our stuff because the issue was with the house. We tried explaining to him what happened and he said that his tech told him a different story from what we are saying and that what we are saying isn\\'t in the report. So I said no what I\\'m telling you is the truth because I saw with my eyes what happened and if report says different then obviously it\\'s just going have down what the tech reported which I\\'m 100% sure was to back himself up. So now we are going on about close to a month with no service or TV and now after all the ** they put us through they\\'re going to finally call us back just to say they are not responsible for our stuff after everyone else we spoke to from Comcast told us they are going to replace our stuff. So he said he was going call somebody and they was going to contact us back. So now I\\'m just waiting for a call that I\\'m sure is not going to come. And I thought to myself first of all I called Comcast to put service in my home, not Cable Net which is a private contractor that help do service for Comcast so I don\\'t know why they made them call me. So I don\\'t know who\\'s paying for my damages but Comcast is going have to do something because did they hired Cable Net to put service in my home that\\'s a issue between them but somebody needs to pay for my stuff. So now I\\'m just here thinking what else can I possibly do to get this take care off. Is legal actions really my only option?

Next day I get a call from Cable Net and they went on saying that they are not responsible for our stuff because the issue was with the house. We tried explaining to him what happened and he said that his tech told him a different story from what we are saying and that what we are saying isn\\'t in the report. So I said no what I\\'m telling you is the truth because I saw with my eyes what happened and if report says different then obviously it\\'s just going have down what the tech reported which I\\'m 100% sure was to back himself up. So now we are going on about close to a month with no service or TV and now after all the ** they put us through they\\'re going to finally call us back just to say they are not responsible for our stuff after everyone else we spoke to from Comcast told us they are going to replace our stuff. So he said he was going call somebody and they was going to contact us back. So now I\\'m just waiting for a call that I\\'m sure is not going to come. And I thought to myself first of all I called Comcast to put service in my home, not Cable Net which is a private contractor that help do service for Comcast so I don\\'t know why they made them call me. So I don\\'t know who\\'s paying for my damages but Comcast is going have to do something because did they hired Cable Net to put service in my home that\\'s a issue between them but somebody needs to pay for my stuff. So now I\\'m just here thinking what else can I possibly do to get this take care off. Is legal actions really my only option? All I want is my TV fixed or replaced and my DVD player, and also some service at a discount for all the ** they put me through. Wish somebody could help me out!!!!', 'row': 797}),\n",

Most notable being kicked off the internet while working, and having to reconnect, sometimes as often as several times an hour. Have spent countless hours on the phone with tech support and have had at least 4 technicians come to my home, crawling through the attic, climbing poles outside, and even replacing the modem. And yet the problem persists. At one point last Sept I signed up for \"Signature Support\" thinking that because I was paying extra for the service, I would get improved service... NOT! Not only did I spend hours on the phone with them trying to resolve problems, but they said the problem was not with the router but the computer. They would gladly fix it for an additional fee (by the way it was NOT the computer). At that point in October I realized this was a scam and called to cancel the service. I documented the phone call because I truly couldn\\'t make this up - it was so absurd. I was on the phone for over 2.5 hours and this is what transpired; the first person I spoke with was in Texas. After explaining the entire situation to her, I was told she was not authorized to remove this service, or charges from my bill. I was then transferred to a gentleman in Manila. Once again explaining the situation, he tried to assure me the service was worth keeping; however I told him I wanted it removed and I wanted an updated bill to document that it actually had been removed. He was not authorized to do so and transferred me to a lady in Manila. Once again I fully explained the situation. After lengthy discussion she said she also could not help me and transferred me to CHICAGO. Once again explaining the situation and asking for an updated bill I was told simply to deduct the fee from my bill. I certainly did not trust this instruction and when I asked again was transferred back to Manila! I gave up!!

This company used to be the best around. They expanded TOO fast; with WAY too much decentralization of services to be remotely consumer friendly.

My boss and I were working late one evening when we noticed that neither one of us could send emails with attachments from any of our multiple webmail accounts (it is worth mentioning that my boss and I work out of his house). This problem forced us to call it quits. The next morning, I find out that after I left the previous evening, my boss spent several hours on the phone with Comcast and did not get the issue resolved. It is then my turn to call Comcast and after talking with several support advisors for hours, including a manager, I got nowhere. After wasting my entire morning, I finally spoke with someone who seems to know more/is more intelligent than the previous Comcast employees that I spoke with. I am told that the reason we are having internet problems is related to the fact that Comcast recently upgraded internet speeds in our area. Apparently, the modem we had (which was rented from Comcast) was not allowing us to access the higher speeds and according to the support person was the root of our problems. I was told that we needed a new modem and that Comcast could send one to us in 3-5 days. Since my boss and I work out of his house, we couldn't wait that long and I went to Best Buy immediately and bought an appropriate modem. It is worth noting that Comcast never sent out a notice in the mail explaining the internet speed increase and the fact that existing equipment might need to be upgraded in order to gain access to the faster speeds.After I installed the new modem and registered it with Comcast, the problem continued. I called a friend who works in the IT industry and he told me to run a speed test. After doing this, I learned that the download speed on the internet is fine but the upload speed is very poor and is the reason we are having problems sending emails with attachments. Again I called up Comcast and after a long conversation, I was told to contact a special technical support department in order to get the problem resolved. I spoke with a manager in this department who explained to me that the problem is on our end with the new modem and can be fixed, but they were going to charge us 50 some odd dollars to do so. At this point, I was fuming mad and told the manager that this was unacceptable. The conversation went nowhere and hang up. I called the regular Comcast support again, and after more time wasting, it is determined that the best course of action is to have a technician to come to my boss’s house.The technician went 3 days later. At some point in days before the appointment, the download speed issue had somehow been fixed and everything was working fine. I could send emails with large attachments without any problems. The technician looked over all the components and checked the cables, and everything was working great.Fast forward a week and one morning, the internet goes from connected to unconnected every few minutes and eventually stays unconnected. I call Comcast again and spend my entire morning trying to have someone help me figure out what’s going on. I tell the Comcast person my experience from the previous week and they decide the best course of action is to send out a technician to the house again. The Comcast person I spoke with tells me that they also want to send a different technician to check the cables and components at the street level. However, based on the schedule, the earliest they can send that technician out is in 4 WEEKS!! I find this totally unacceptable and am told that this is the best they can do.A day or so later, my boss speaks with a neighbor down the street who has been experiencing the similar problems with their Comcast internet. The house technician shows up two days after this and we are finally told the truth. THE ENTIRE STREET AND NEIGHBORING STREETS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS!!

Now, it seems that when I want to move my service to a new address, no one seems to know how to fix it! I am only on now because of my iPhone and the wifi in my new building (which is painfully slow)! My wife and I operate home-based businesses and rely on the internet. I can suffer without the cable TV for a day or two, but cannot be without the net, for which they have already billed me for. We had an expedited service call with a confirmation number to have a tech come to our house today. After no show, we called again and after an hour on the phone was told that someone called and came by, but we were not there. That is simply not true. Phone records support no call and a service tech must check in with our concierge to enter the building which was not done! Poor service and dishonest too! I posted numerous complaints to their Facebook page since their corporate website is useless and this is what I got from them moments ago: \"Tracy, your FB posts have also been shared with the executives at corporate. You can also send your detailed account to the email address you used yesterday (comcast_cares@comcast.com). Just to let you know, we removed the multiple posts with the phone number listed.\"So you see, they have decided to remove my posts, rather than fix the problem. Really smooth!', 'row': 829}),\n",

I called repeatedly; they kept saying the tech was on the way and that once the service was up, they could prorate the account.

Well, that just brought the cost down to what it was before the increase. Yippee! I am fed up with being tied up by a self serving ISP. FiOS is not available and Dish isn't much better. If anyone is as angry as I am, I urge you to write to your local government agency among others, as I am. One site is GovSpot.com.\", 'row': 842}),\n",

As far as I know, Comcast holds a monopoly at my address as Comcast is apparently the only high speed internet service available to me at my Olympia address. On December 15, 2012, my internet service quit working. I called Comcast to report the outage or malfunction. I was put on hold for probably the better part of an hour. Eventually, my call was transferred. After transfer, I was offered a service for under $10.00 (it was either $9.95 or $9.99, but I can't remember which). I was told that it would be a one-time charge and that if I agreed to pay nearly $10.00, they could fix the problem - which according to them was my problem, not Comcast's. I was impressed with the fact that the agents on the phone seemed incompetent and incapable of listening to me to find out the description of the problem. They put me on hold again. I was impressed with what appeared to be their method of guessing what the problem might be and guessing how it might be fixed. I'm a good guesser too, so I wasn't too sure that I wanted to pay them almost $10.00 to do what I could do equally well myself, but I was in a state of disbelief at that moment because I thought that rationally they should know what they are doing. While I was on hold, I fixed the problem myself. When the agent came back on the line, I said never mind. I didn't need their help and I didn't want to go back on hold again. They said okay. We hung up.Later, I received a letter from Comcast captioned: Welcome to Xfinity Signature Support. This looked suspicious to me, as if I were signed up from something I didn't want. So I called Comcast on December 26, 2012 to inquire and to make sure I wasn't going to get billed. I was put on hold for more than an hour. When an agent finally came on the line, she told me that the charge would be removed and that the subscription would be cancelled. I thanked her and I hung up. On January 11, 2013, the monthly bill from Comcast arrived. There was a charge of $39.00 for an item described as enrollment fee with a sub-line as follows: Wireless Networking and Computer Performance.

Fortunately, my T-Mobile phone service had hotspot capabilities, so I was able to use my tablet to surf the internet and do my reports for work. On the third time they came out to my location, my wife was home and the guy told her the cable to the entire neighborhood was out when in fact he was too big to access the crawl space. So, he told her he would call it in on Tuesday when he returned to work. Mind you, it was Saturday afternoon. It's a technology company. Why would it take so many days to report the problem? I called Monday and put in another service call and the same technician came back. Rather than lie to me and tell me the crawl space was too small for his rotund self, he ran another cable on the outside of my house. Now I have a cable sticking out of the siding at my front door. He also had another technician come over to supposedly help him with the install when in fact they were just running their mouths. The cable went out again and I called to speak with a supervisor and was on the phone for over 1 hour with no resolve, just a bunch of promises to be called back. My uncle died that Friday and I went to NY for the funeral. They called me while I was in NYC walking into the funeral home, so I cancelled the appointment and asked to just reschedule it for a later date and never heard anything from them again.

After having slow internet speed with Verizon in my husband and I's first home, we decided to transfer to Comcast. I believe this was the biggest mistake we could have made! We have had Comcast for a little over a month now. For some reason, all of the cable lines running to our home were cut, so Comcast had to fix the problem before we could get internet. In one week, we had scheduled for three different technicians to come to our home. Well, the first appointment was missed so we called that day after the scheduled time. We were told that they had cancelled our appointment and rescheduled it without telling us! So we waited about 3 days later for our second appointment. No one showed. We waited a couple hours past our appointment time and finally, someone showed. However, he was not doing what he was scheduled to do! We called Comcast and told them of our problem, that the technician did not know how the first appointment was missed and so he was working on preparing us for the third appointment instead of the second. They told us that they were at fault for not communicating to that technician. Finally, the third appointment day came and no one showed! We were so frustrated at this point that we called and spoke to the highest person up about what all has happened and demanded for their Comcast Customer Guarantee ($20 for each missed appointment). She said that $60 would be given to us and deducted from our bills. Being a little satisfied after that phone call, we waited about one more week until the last technician could come out and fix everyone's problems. This man was very disappointed with our service so far and therefore did more than what he was supposed to do and admitted that Comcast has horrible communication with their technicians. So for about two or three weeks, we had fantastic wireless internet speed until about a week and a half ago. Our internet speed has been incredibly slow. We have made several (9) phone calls to Comcast and every person reset our modem and told us that they do not know how else to help. Finally, we demanded for a technician to come out and check our end of everything. When he came out, he stayed for about an hour and a half checking to make sure that nothing wrong was coming from us. He checked both of our computers, our router and our modem. He even gave us a brand new modem for free just to ensure that nothing was wrong on our end! When he left, he stated that the IT department that Comcast works with created the problem and he sent in a ticket that would be corrected within the next 24 hours. Well, here we are 72 hours later with incredibly slow internet. For about a week and a half, we have had a download speed of between 0.08-0.26 (when we are paying for 24.0) and an upload speed of 4.5 (when we are paying for between 3-4).

Both my husband and I had to talk to the IT department, who was very rude and inconsiderate. He said they saw the problem but the fact that we called him was because that we had the problem that they had to fix. We very politely told him that we were told that they created the problem and therefore we should not be charged for them to fix the problem that they created. After being interrupted many times from this man, we asked him to forward us to the highest possible person with Comcast. We were sent to the automatic voice when you call Comcast at the very beginning without the man saying a word to us before he left. We called one last time and they said that they would send out a technician, to do the same thing that was done 72 hours ago.

We didn\\'t see any Comcast technician between that time. Finally at 3:00PM, a third party technician showed up without proper tools and left. He told us he would return first thing the following morning to get this taken care of. We didn\\'t see the technician the following morning, so I called him on the cell number he gave us.

He started to give me a story about why we didn\\'t see the technician between 9:00 to 11:00 and I had said, \"Look, I really don\\'t want an apology and don\\'t want to hear it.\" His manager, Brent or Brett called back and we were told something would be done on Friday. At 3:00PM on a Friday afternoon, when most people leave early for a weekend, the technician showed up. By this time, Mr. ** has left on Thursday for his vacation that I know he has not enjoyed because he has been on his cell phone constantly to check on updates. I did leave the office at 3:30 on Friday because I had already planned to leave early. While I was out of town on Saturday morning, I received a telephone call from Fernando ** to check on the telephone and internet status since he was out of the office on Friday. I told him we had gotten internet started, but not completed, but we really needed our telephones. He called me back 20 minutes later and told me there would be someone at our office at 8:00AM sharp.

I was told to take my old modem in and get a new one. When I plugged in the brand new modem, it not only took out my internet connection, it killed my phone service.

So I went searching for internet through Comcast as I already had my cable TV through them. I spoke with a woman and told her I was looking for a better deal for internet service, and asked what she could do for me. She told me about different plans. One was what is called Econo Internet Service, it sounded very reasonable. The installation would be spread out over 4 months on my bill. Then there after my payment would be $26.99 + $7.00 for the box rental total $33.99 a month. This month our bill came from Comcast and my husband was furious as our total bill with cable was $123.63. My husband has been out of work since January of this year. So we started to go over our cable bill and realized that for the last 3 months the internet was $36.95 and $35.30. So my husband called Comcast to talk about the problem with the price of the internet. Not only was it wrong, but the math for the internet part of billing was wrong. They informed my husband that that internet service we got from them was a promotional, which is an outright lie because I was the one (Linda **) who spoke with the representative for Comcast when I got the internet. And she informed me that she has this particular plan Econo Internet Service and was really pleased with it. At no time during our conversation discussing the price after installation was paid off that this was a promotional fee. And that it would have gone up. If she had, I would have declined to get it and searched elsewhere for a better deal. Because of my husband being unemployed at this time, money is almost non-existent and every penny counts. And one thing we have to have is the internet for him to search for work and keep applying every week for his unemployment benefits. So instead of canceling the internet for the time being, we had to change our cable TV programs to accommodate for the unfair practice in extorting more money from the consumers. Now I understand why Comcast is rated one of the ten worst companies. They deserve the title. But mark my word. As soon as my husband is employed again, I will kiss Comcast internet goodbye.

I spoke with a sales rep from the company, Lyn **, and she told me that the transfer process from Century Link would be \"seamless\" and our services will be down for a max. of about 5 min and that we would have to cancel our Century Link Internet (I have e-mail record). The tech came to switch our phone numbers and added cable internet. He looked at our system and said, \"I cannot touch that phone system\" (it is a POPP system). I was baffled because I informed Lyn that we had a POPP phone system. He informed me that we would need to hire a phone tech to work while another Comcast tech came. This cost us an additional $150 and totally wasted my day because I had cleared my afternoon to assist the tech. We had the phone tech come out and the Comcast tech (who was 10 mins late) and set up our phones and internet. All was fine. No problems other than the tech messed with my routers and killed our database for good. We have a domain name and we use the domain for our e-mail. I came to work on Monday after the switch and found out that we were still using Century Link internet servers for our e-mail. I thought, \"Great. I will pay for both services and switch the domain name from Century Link during the weekend when we will have no e-mails going through, thus making the switch seamless.\" Well, to my surprise, when I came in to work on Wednesday, Comcast had suspended our services from Century Link (without our permission) and we had no e-mail server/service. I am in the sales business and no e-mail means no orders received. I called Comcast and they said, \"No problem. We will just add your domain to your account.\" Great. He walked me through setting up the vanity domain name and then instructed me to go through our host server (**) and have them add our new, **, and target value. The process was supposed to take 24 hours, but could take up to 48. Not so great. After 24 hours, I called the Host to ask if all the information was \"propagated\" and the tech said, \"It should all have been sent sometime last night.\" So, he said it is Comcast who was in error. The blame game begins. I call Comcast and they say that it has to be the Host who has not sent the information. After about 7 phone calls and 4 hours, I finally got a manager to talk to at Comcast, Jason out of the Denver office. He said he would call the host company and figure out what is going on and call me back in 2 hours. 2 hours came and went. I angrily went home. Now, it is day 3 (still with no e-mails) and the domain name is still \"provisioning.\" I called Comcast and asked to speak to a different manager because Jason lied to me and never called me back (and the host said he never called them either). Now, I deal with the manager whose name is Dustin. He said that Jason had \"escalated\" the ticket to their Tier 2 techs yesterday and it will be 48 hours until I will get a response. I got upset because this issue has already been going on 48 hours and it would appear on my end that they have done nothing. I finally got Dustin to talk to our host (had to make a conference call) and Dustin said he would have his Tier 3 tech call them and figure out what is going on. He said I should receive a response in about 2 hours. I waited 2 and got a call from the Tier 3 tech, Kris (after 48 hours, you would think it would already be at Tier 3). He said it had something to do with Century Link not releasing the domain. He said he would work on it and give me a call back. I then called Century Link and asked if Comcast had called in regards to our account. They informed me that they had no record of receiving a call from Comcast regarding our domain name.

I made it extremely clear to him that my home phone was also out due to no internet service. I told him the only phone they could reach me on was my cell phone. He understood and made a change of phone number on the work order. Saturday morning, I made a call to tech support to make sure they had the right phone number on the work order. The lady assured me that it was 3pm, Saturday. No service tech. I called tech support, talked to a Curt. He assured me that his tech was just late, be patient and he would be here. I also reminded him of the number to reach me. He said yes the tech had the right number. Curt also told me congratulations. Because the tech was late, Comcast was going to credit my account $20. How nice but guess what, no truck ever came. I called Comcast and got a recording saying our service was cancelled because the tech could not reach us. Guess what number they were calling, my home number that didn’t work. Back on phone, I got a live woman from Georgia. She called me Mr. ** and told me she would solve my problem. She got me another appointment for Sunday, June 3, 2012 at 8-9 am. She positively assured that the problem was solved. She made it fool proof for the tech to call the wrong number. She even gave me another $20 and 6 months of HBO free. Sunday morning 9am, no service tech. You aren’t surprised to hear that right. Does this Groundhog Day the movie called Comcast at 9am? The woman I spoke to said, oh I know what the problem is. The bad computer doesn’t know that your home phone doesn’t work. She said I will fix it. I will take that bad number out of the computer and enter my cell number. No more mistakes. The woman assured me I would hear from the tech within 3 hours to give me his arrival time. Eight hours later and guess what, no call, no service tech. I just can’t believe that there are that many people employed at Comcast that don’t remotely know how to order repair service or just don’t care. The old 8 and skate crowd.', 'row': 885}),\n",

There was not enough amount in my bank so I offered him another card and told him to get the total amount from the two cards. He told me that I will pay double shipment if I have to use two cards for payment. I did not want that so I rushed and deposited some cash in the bank to make the payment from one card.

The only reason that I needed a business account/static IP was that my wife needed it per her employer at the time. The situation was that I took a new job in Memphis and my wife moved with me from California. At the time, she was allowed by her California employer to work remotely but was told she would need a static IP in order to connect with the company network. The only way that Comcast will provide a static IP address is with a business account.A few months after moving here, my wife's employer decided that the long distance thing was not working out and my wife had to look for a new job. When this first happened, I contacted Comcast to see what my options were in regards to dropping the static IP and the commercial account, and switching over to a residential account for personal use only. I was told that they could drop the static IP without penalty but that I would be responsible for the full term of the business contract which was 36 months. When I first talked to Comcast in regards to opening this account, I was under the impression that the term was for one year which is all I would ever agree to, under the circumstances. When I signed the service order, I did not notice that it was for 36 months. I just checked the agreement real quick to ensure that the monthly charges were as agreed to and signed it. That was my mistake but at the time I was scrambling to get moved that I got a little careless. So, we did drop the static IP and I decided that I would just live with the higher commercial rate for my personal internet access. Now, we are moving from the apartment we live in to a duplex in another part of town where the landlord pays for internet access, so I need to cancel the service in its entirety. However, I am running into a brick wall. The customer service reps tell me that I will have to pay a penalty which amounts to $1318 which I cannot afford. I also do not believe that I am responsible for this either.I have read the Terms and Conditions which state that this penalty will be charged if the customer terminates service without cause. In the section regarding termination for cause, it lists termination of business as cause which I am positive my wife's situation qualifies for. So, I should be able to cancel without penalty. So it comes down to this. The original business needed for a static IP and thus a business account no longer exists.

I moved to Uverse whom soon after activated the same limits as Comcast. After having billing issues with AT&T, I moved in with my grandfather and I decided to give Comcast another try. On Monday 04-02-11, I called to add internet to my grandfather's account. I confirmed details such as the name on the account, account number and address. The service was added without a problem and I was told to call back in one hour to activate the service. I called back on Tuesday 4-3-12 to add the MAC address and activate the service. I spoke to the tech department and provided the MAC address to the rep (the modem started to work immediately). The rep then requested the social security number of the account holder. I explained that the service had been added on Monday and that this information was not requested at that time. I voiced my opinion and stated that whatever information was needed to add a service should have been asked for at the time that the service was added. I informed him that the account holder was unavailable at the time due to the fact that he was sleeping at this time (9:30 pm). The rep insisted on the information. I decided to go speak to my grandfather and provided the last four numbers requested. The rep then requested to speak to my grandfather.

I voiced my opinion and stated that whatever information was needed to add a service should have been asked for at the time that the service was added.

I contacted Comcast to find out what the problem was but found that they were unable to locate my account in the system. After approximately 15 minutes of searching, they located my account and determined the individual who installed my service did not \"push\" the order through and they would need to correct this matter. Within 90 minutes the internet was back up but the landline was not. I was told I would receive a phone call to confirm the landline was taken care of but that call never came. Just 45 minutes after the internet was restored, it went down again. I again contacted Comcast and the matter was \"fixed,\" but they still could not locate the phone number and that matter would be looked into and I would receive a phone call. That phone call also never came. I decided to do business with another company and have the phone number ported over. After four days of the new company being unable to port the number over, I contacted Comcast and was transferred to four different individuals before I decided to cancel the entire thing and get a new phone number. I was told I would not receive a bill because I cancelled in less than 30 days. I was never instructed where or when the equipment needed to be returned, so I took it upon myself to do this. I received a bill reflecting a balance and when I called to inquire about the charges, I was told the bill was incorrect and that I in fact did not have a balance and a new bill would be sent out. On 3/24/12, I returned the modem and router to the Comcast store in Richmond, VA. On 4/3/12, I received a bill reflecting a credit but not for the entire amount.

I don\\'t have DVR service, I don\\'t have the equipment. Second, I am being charged for a top-tier of services, including multiple channels, which I do not have access to, and that includes the DVR, telephone (which has been disconnected completely) and high-speed internet.

Lastly, I have called, emailed, and \"chatted\" for approximately 20 hours since January about these issues, and nothing changed. Well, they did disconnect my phone but two weeks earlier than requested and they are still charging me for having the service.You might ask why I continue with Comcast, it’s because there are no other providers that I can obtain service with. I live in a high-rise apartment, and have been told by Dish, DirecTV and AT&T that since the management has a contract with these providers, the individual tenants cannot obtain individual service.

I thought this was taken care of, but depending on what day I look at my bill, the $39 charge is there some months, not there some months, but the bills are still too high for what I have purchased from Comcast.

Comcast refuses to lower my bill while I am not getting the correct speeds, and insists I continue to pay full price for a service which I am not getting. Unfortunately, Comcast has a lock on the downtown DC area, including this building, and no other provider is able to service this building to provide internet services. Still, that does not give them the authority to charge for a service that they are unable to provide. ', 'row': 918}),\n",

In February, I placed an order to move my service to my new house. The new service was activated on Saturday, March 3. I had several issues with my cable, but they have now been resolved. I continue to have issues with internet, more specifically, my Comcast email. When the new service was activated, the Comcast installer did not bring a router. We could not get wireless to work with the Comcast router that I brought with me from my previous residence. I was instructed to call Comcast to order a router, which I did. It arrived about 4 days later and I activated it according to the directions. Everything was fine for a couple of days. Then my email no longer worked. It did not work at my home, it did not work on my Blackberry and it did not work when I took my laptop with me to Starbucks, etc. I called Comcast only to discover that they had shut my email addresses down. Apparently, the move order did not include (although I made a point of requesting) the transfer of my email addresses and they had been cancelled. During this call, I was assured they could turn my emails back on and that it would take about 48 hours. True to their word, I had email again in approximately 48 hours. But about 24 hours later, problems started. This was on or about Thursday, March 15. I could log in to my Comcast email account, but when I attempted to open any of my emails, I got an error message stating that the webpage could not be displayed. I tried my second laptop and the same thing happened. I called Comcast and was informed that I had problems with my laptop and was instructed to follow directions to reset my browser and other things specific to my laptop. It did not help on either of my laptops. My first call about this problem ended with no resolution. I decided the next day to take my laptop to Starbucks. I was able to log in and open all of my emails at Starbucks, so I called Comcast when I returned home. Now on March 17, to explain that the problem probably was not my laptop since I did not have the problem except at my residence, it was then suggested that I needed a new (another new router since the ones I was using was only a few days old) router/modem. It was shipped via expedited shipping and it arrived on Wednesday, March 21. Once again, I installed and activated the new modem/router and even with the new router, I continued to have the same problem. I called Comcast and was eventually told that a ticket had been issued to bump up my case to national (?), another level of customer service, and that I would get a call within 24 hours. I did not get the call and so tonight, Friday, March 23, I called Comcast again. I was told, after being instructed to reset my browser, which I opted not to do because I do not trust Comcast to fix anything and do not feel good about following any instructions that mess with my equipment, that the case follow-up phone call did not have a deadline until Saturday, March 24. I opted to end my call to Comcast at that time and waited for the call on Saturday, March 24. I am beyond frustrated over the problem and Comcast's inability to fix my problem.

I informed Judy that if the bill was any higher, I already had checked other servicers and told her I was ready to switch (which was also true and was prepared to switch to Century Link). Judith told me to wait and check the amount to pay on the online account which would allow me to continue at the rate of approximately $42.00/month without the \"blast\". To enforce our agreement, I checked the account which turned out to be around $15.00. All in all, Judith the Comcast representative undoubtedly stated she could keep our bill to around $42.00/month if we paid this extra amount to account for services already performed.Unfortunately, none of what Judith communicated to me was true. Comcast did not keep their word or honor their agreement. After paying the amount online as agreed, the next month I received a bill for over $115.00 which was not agreed upon and a breach of the agreement.

After 3-5 days and more than10 phone calls, I finally received my equipment (cable HD box and wireless router); however, I noticed that none of it functioned properly. So once again I had to call Comcast to request another HD box or send a technician to my residence. The first technician never showed up; the second tech didn’t step foot inside my residence; rather, he just went behind my home and said he turned the cable on from there. When I came home that day, I noticed my cable still was not working and neither was my internet! At this point, it was December 14, 2011 and I had become increasingly upset! The third tech was great! He appeared concerned and wanted nothing more than to right the wrong Comcast has committed (that and poor customer service are apparently the only things for which you can provide). He took his time to set everything up: outside working in the back and inside testing out the wire until finally we were on track and my cable and internet worked. Comcast failed yet again as he was never instructed to bring an HD DVR box or a wireless router.

I have been begging and pleading for some sort of assistance since I ordered the service in November 2011. My wife is deployed in Afghanistan and makes every attempt to call when she has time. Though we could web chat via Skype, ooVoo, or web-based video links on my wireless devices if I had internet access that’s compatible with Skype or video services, but I don’t.

I contacted Comcast to sign up and was told I would need to pay extra for their router. I told them their mailing did not indicate that and that I had my own router. They said it had to be their router. I asked what kind they used that was so special. They put me on hold and then came back on line and asked what router I had. I told them I had Linksys and another brand (I can\\'t remember the brand off hand). They said neither would work. I asked again what brand they use and was told she didn\\'t know as that was a technical question.After being transferred around, I was finally told there was a list of routers on their website that would work with their service. I discovered buying a router on my own was much cheaper than renting from Comcast, thus I went and bought one of the routers on their list. The tech showed up to install my internet and left without even telling me. He said he was going outside to check the line and he must have left because the next thing I knew, I was getting a phone call from Comcast with an automated message asking me to rate my recent service. I looked outside and sure enough the service truck was gone. The tech never even checked to see if the internet worked. I also never received any paperwork. I stated as much in the review and rated accordingly. Since it was a substandard review, I was asked if I wanted a rep to contact me. I indicated yes. Someone called back and I explained the situation and that I didn\\'t even get any paperwork or \"set up kit\" the survey had referred to. The rep apologized and stated they would mail everything to me. It\\'s been a year and I never received it.The first bill I received was for almost $100. I called and asked about it and was told it was for the service call and the first 2 months of service. I told them the bill should be around $40 as I was only paying $20 a month and there was free installation. I took about a month for them to resolve the issue and straighten my bill out. Thankfully, the following 11 months went by with no issues. In November, I bought a wireless printer and needed to hook it up to my wireless internet. I couldn\\'t locate my WEP key so contacted Comcast asking for advice. After being transferred around, disconnected, transferred around again and then routed back to the original department I had called, I was told they could maybe help me, but it would cost $50. The rep tried selling this service telling me how it used to be a $120 house call for this, but now they could remotely access my computer and usually gets the WEP key that way. Usually, I asked about that and was told that if they were unsuccessful, they would send someone out for the $120. Since they were only looking into my computer for the code, I asked if I couldn\\'t just find it myself. The rep assured me there was no way I would be able to do this as it required a high level of technical training and computer knowledge as I would need to change and reset computer settings, etc. I asked again, but it\\'s possible?This argument continued for at least 5-10 minutes before the rep grudgingly and rather rudely admitted that yes, it was possible it could be done, but there was no way I, myself, would be able to do it. I told him it was worth a try and disconnected. The whole call from first initial dial to disconnect was 57 minutes; just to ask a question. I went on line and Googled how to recover misplaced WEP key. There were many, many places to look. The first site I went to recommended looking on the bottom of the router as often times it is written there. The second site I went to (specifically for my brand router) offered similar advice, stating all you need to do is log into your account- user name and password located on bottom of router. I turned my router upside down, located web address, user name and password, logged in, went to setting and found my WEP key. No technical skills, no computer knowledge, no problem. Time from first Google key stroke to locating WEP key- 5 minutes.January 2, 2011. I went on line to pay my bill- due Jan 7. My bill shows I owe almost $50. This is strange since I have been paying roughly $22-23 a month for the last year. Knowing if I paid the full amount I would never get my money back, I contacted Comcast direct and discovered it was after 8pm and I would need to call again tomorrow. Jan. 3, I called back and spoke with Stacy. Initially, she told me the deal was for only 12 months. Not so, I told her. It was for 24 months and they were the ones that solicited my business. She put me on hold and came back and said she confirmed that my deal was $14.99 a month for 12 months with an additional $5 a month charge for router rental. I told her they owed me a refund then, because I own my own router.She put me on hold again then returned and stated I was on the $19.99/month special for 6 months. I told her to check my billing history as I had been paying this amount for a year. Then she said it must have been a 12 month deal. I again told her it was a 24 month deal and I wouldn\\'t pay my bill until they fixed it. She stated she would have to put in a ticket and would get back to me tomorrow (Wed) or Saturday. I never figured out the delay for that one. I never heard back on Wed or Sat. Nor Sun, Mon or Tues. I checked my bill and now it showed almost $100 as my bill was now late and they had added another month. I tried calling Tues night but, again, it was after 8pm and they were closed. I sent an email which guaranteed a response in 24 hrs. I explained that my bill was incorrect and needed to be fixed and that Stacy had promised to get back to me and never did.I did not get a reply to my email in 24 hrs, 48 hrs, or 72 hrs. Jan 12 I call Comcast again. I explain the billing problem and that no one is fixing it or getting back to me. I make the comment; I guess they don\\'t want to get their money. I get transferred to the resolution center and speak to Kelly who is extremely apologetic and assure me she will resolve this problem. She comments she sees I spoke to Stacy who is actually a supervisor and awesome customer service. I told Kelly I may have agreed with her assessment of Stacy if Stacy had ever called me back like she promised. Kelly put me on hold to try and get in touch with Stacy. Kelly came back on the line and stated Stacy wasn\\'t at her desk but that she would send an email to someone (unknown who) to get the matter resolved ASAP. Kelly assured me she would get back to me today no matter what.
